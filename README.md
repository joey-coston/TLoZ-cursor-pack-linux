# TLoZ-cursor-pack-linux
A cursor pack with several cursors themed after The Legend of Zelda game 
franchise.
These cursors are designed for a FHD screen resolution and may appear too small 
on a 4K monitor.

----------------------------------The Basics-----------------------------------
To use these cursors, unzip the package and place the folder labeled 
./TLOZ-Joseph-Coston under the system directory /usr/share/icons. You may then 
go into open system settings->appearance->themes and under the "mouse pointer" 
section, select the theme labeled "TLOZ-Joseph-Coston"


----------------------------------Advanced-------------------------------------
If you want to edit the cursor animations (like the frames, frame timing, 
cursor hotspots, etc...) then you can edit the corresponding files under 
./cursor-source-images/ and its subdirectories. Each cursor is placed in its
own directory with all the frames that make it up, and a config file. Some of 
them even have a Windows-compatible .ani or .cur file I made to go along with 
them. The cursor labeling is more descriptive of the appearance of the cursor 
than the actual system naming convention of the cursor so if you are going to 
do your own thing here, you'll have to propperly rename the X11 compatible 
cursor files you make with names that linux recognizes before replacing them
in the cursor pack to suit your preferences.

Happy pointing,
Joseph Coston
