# TLoZ-cursor-pack-linux
A cursor pack with several cursors themed after The Legend of Zelda game franchise.
These cursors are designed for a FHD screen resolution and may appear too small on a 4K monitor.

To use these cursors, unzip the package and place the folder labeled ./TLOZ-Joseph-Coston/ under
the system directory /usr/share/icons. You may then go into open system settings->appearance->themes
and under the "mouse pointer" section, select the theme labeled "TLOZ-Joseph-Coston"

If you get the watch a lot, say hi to Navi!
